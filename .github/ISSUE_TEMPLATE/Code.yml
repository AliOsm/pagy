        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

        ### IMPORTANT
        
        _Code Issues are reserved for real, reproducible pagy bugs. If you are not sure it's a bug, 
        please ask for help in the 
        [Q&A](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a) discussion area._        
        
        ### PREREQUISITE
        
        **We need a code support to reproduce the problem with a single click or command
        in order to start to work on the solution immediately.** 
        
        Please, understand that we cannot write the code that fails for you.
        No matter how well you can describe your code, not matter how many snippets 
        you paste in the description, we need a self contained code that we can run with a single click or command 
        or in very simple cases a copy and paste in vanilla IRB (no rails console).
        
        Please, choose the support that is most convenient for you below...
