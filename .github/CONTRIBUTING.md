# Pagy Contributions

Pull Requests are welcome!

Before spending time creating a (potentially complex) Pull Request, you can [Confirm Feature Request](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/feature-requests) to ensure that your proposed changes are going to be useful for most users.

If you Create A Pull Request, please ensure  that the tests passed and Codecov and Rubocop are happy. The "All checks have passed" indicator should get green light on the Pull Request page (if it's not enabled, some maintainer will enable it for you).

Thank you!
